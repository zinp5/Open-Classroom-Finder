heres my project Open Classroom Finder:
I think empty classrooms are the best place to study, so I created a tool to find open classrooms.
If you're curious or just want to flame my mid ass code, I have all the source code and data files in the source code.
If you'd like to build OCF yourself, follow the instructions
Steps to run OCF if you trust the exe
-------------------------------------------
1. Place "TimeDisplayer.exe" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
2. Run "TimeDisplayer.exe"
3. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
4. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again

Steps to run OCF if you have python or don't trust the exe
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Place "TimeDisplayer.py" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
2. Make sure you have the proper libraries installed
3. run "TimeDisplayer.py" however you run python
4. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
5. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again
