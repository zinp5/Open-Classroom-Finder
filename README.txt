heres my project Open Classroom Finder
I think empty classrooms are the best place to study, so I created a tool to find empty classrooms.

Steps to run OCF if you trust the exe
-------------------------------------------
1. Place "TimeDisplayer.exe" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
2. Run "TimeDisplayer.exe"
3. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
4. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again

Steps to run OCF if you have python or don't trust the exe
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Place "TimeDisplayer.py" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
2. Make sure you have the proper libraries installed
3. run "TimeDisplayer.py" however you run python
4. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
5. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again


>>>>>>> Note that the project must be updated every quarter to keep information up to date! <<<<<<<<<
I plan on updating it myself, but you can do it yourself too
If you want to know how to make it yourself, just follow the instructions / source code i left (it'll take some work on your end though, gotta change some paths, change some variables....)

If you're curious or just want to flame my code, I have all the source code available 
    order of code: 10,15,20,25.... with 0 being code and 5 being .txt data

If you'd like to build a better version of OCF for yourself, you are welcome to build off of any code or .txt data
