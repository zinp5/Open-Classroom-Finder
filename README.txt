heres my project Open Classroom Finder
I think empty classrooms are the best place to study, so I created a tool to find empty classrooms.

Steps to run OCF if you trust the exe
-------------------------------------------
1. Go to "Releases" on the right side of the screen
2. Download "TimeDisplayer.exe" and "csvFormatFull.txt"
3. Place "TimeDisplayer.exe" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
4. Run "TimeDisplayer.exe"
5. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
6. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again

Steps to run OCF if you have python or don't trust the exe
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to "Releases" on the right side of the screen
2. Download "TimeDisplayer.py" and "csvFormatFull.txt"
3. Place "TimeDisplayer.py" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
4. Make sure you have the proper libraries installed
5. run "TimeDisplayer.py" however you run python
6. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
7. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again


>>>>>>> Note that the project must be updated every quarter to keep information up to date! <<<<<<<<<
I plan on updating it myself, but you can do it yourself too
If you want to know how to make it yourself, just follow the instructions / source code i left 
(it'll take some work on your end though, gotta change some paths, change some variables, change some file names...)

If you're curious or just want to flame my code, I have all the source code available 
    order of code: 10,15,20,25.... with 0 being code and 5 being .txt data

If you'd like to build a better version of OCF for yourself, you are welcome to build off of any code or .txt data
