Steps to run OCF if you trust the exe
-------------------------------------------
1. Place "TimeDisplayer.exe" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
2. Run "TimeDisplayer.exe"
3. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
4. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again

Steps to run OCF if you have python or don't trust the exe
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Place "TimeDisplayer.py" and "csvFormatFull.txt" in same folder
2. Make sure you have the proper libraries installed
3. run "TimeDisplayer.py" however you run python
4. Select desired time and hall (cntrl-f is helpful)
5. Once done reading times, close the graph. the program will automatically loop again


Steps to completely build on your own (its a total mess right now with input and output method disrepencies lol)

Pseudo:
Grab course tiles
Run loop against schedule builder using course tiles to get class info
clean and organize class info
print desired class

1. (Grab course title html) Run "GrabRawCourseTitle.py", pipe output "rawcoursetitles.txt" to folder of "CoursetitlesParse.cpp"

2. (Parse course title html) Run "CourseTitlesParse.cpp", pipe "rawcoursetitles.txt" as input, pipe output to "CourseNamesParsed.txt" to folder of "LoopForSchedBuilderSearch.py"

3. (Search schedule builder and grab time html's) Run "LoopForSchedBuildSearch.py" with "CourseNamesParsed.txt" in the same folder. Output will be in folder named "responses".
		"responses" must exist before running. in the "responses" folder, the program will make individual output for each course name

4. (Combine raw schedule response html) Run "UnparsedFileCombiner.py", manually edit input folderpath to wherever "responses" exists. Output file "UnparsedCombined.txt" will be placed in same folder as "UnparsedFileCombiner.py"

5. (Parse combined raw schedule) Run "2ndclassTimeParse.cpp", pipe "UnparsedCombined.txt" as input, pipe ouput to "csvFormatFull.txt" into the same folder as "TimeDisplayer.py"

6. (Display times) Run "TimeDisplayer.py" with "csvFormatFull.txt" in the same folder.
